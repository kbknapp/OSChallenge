# The Rig

I forgot to get all the specs prior to moving on...so here's what I remember: 

```
OS: elementary OS 5.0 Juno x86_64 
Host: Precision 7710 
Kernel: 4.20.something
Shell: zsh 5.4.2 
Resolution: 1920x1080, 1680x1050, 1680x1050 
Terminal: tilix 
DE: Budgie
CPU: Intel i7-6820HQ (8) @ 3.600GHz 
GPU: AMD Radeon HD 8890M 
Memory: 64354MiB 
```

# Positives

* Fast. Wow.
* `eopkg` (I know it's being replaced with `sol`), but it's super fast and easy to use
* I liked the theme of the terminal a lot

# Negatives

* EFI Table too small
  * Wow this was infuriating if you dual boot you have to manually delete, remove, re-add, etc. a new EFI partition or Solus won't let you install. 
  * This can also cause your dual OSs to not boot. 
  * This should not happen. 
  * If there is enough space to install, then install. 
  * How does every other OS out there install except this one?
* Budgie snap to edge with windows would wig out and either freeze or stutter and then not snap to edge
* Software Center has some strange quirks, like back button not really taking you back
* Froze and become unbootable after an update
* Software can be lacking
* Project leads can be terse
  * I.e. Answer honest questions with single word answers, "No." or in sarcastic ways
  * Won't accept contributions in certain programming languages purely on principal (i.e. no Rust ever)
  * Denies software into the repositories if it at all matches functionality of other applications (sounds good...but see below for explanation)

# General Thoughts

I wrote longer prose about the points above, and my general feelings about eOS. However, it's difficult to give criticism (even constructive) publicly online without coming across as overly negative. Hence, these thoughts are in a private repository. If you are intereseted, you can message me to read them.

The TL;DR is eOS is Solus is FAST. I love how ambitious it is. However, some large issues make it a no-go for me. I also feel put off by the project leadership, but that is highly subjective. I'll continue to watch Solus in case it continues to improve.
